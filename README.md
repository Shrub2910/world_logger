# Word logger

## What is it
World logger is a discord bot that allows the user to create a fantasy world for either a videogame or book.
By using various slash command the user can create, edit and visualise an entire fantasy world 

## Features of the bot (Yet to be implemented)
There will be the ability to create characters, locations, items, weapons, classes and more
There will be many tools implemented to allow the user to visualise the whole world as well such as trees
Automatic role asignment on discord to give permissions to people to modify the world
Ability to upload images to customize discord embeds for any element of their world

## Roadmap
I hope to create most of the text based stuff to begin with such as names for different elements and descriptions
Then I will work on making things look pretty with different visualisers 
Images might take longer to implement as I would need a large amount of storage
